# Module_18_Challenge

# Blockchain-based Ledger System

---

## Introduction:

The premise of this project is that I am a fintech engineer whoâ€™s working at one of the five largest banks in the world. I was recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. My task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions, transferring money between senders and receivers, and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following modules:

* [streamlit](https://streamlit.io) - For turning data scripts into shareable web apps.

* [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) - For manipulating dates and times.

* [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) - Provides a decorator and functions for automatically adding generated special methods.

* [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) - Provides runtime support for type hints.

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - For reading data into a DataFrame and analyzing data via statistics and plots.

* [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) - For a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms.

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html) - For embedding plots in the application.
